    The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby and his love life as a single man.
    His stories are narrated by an older Ted Mosby as he tells them to his adolescent children,
    Luke (named after Luke Skywalker) and Penny (named after Ted's love for coins).
    The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with 27-year-old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect.
    The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen, a law student,
    and Lily Aldrin, a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes,
    as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson, and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky.

    While the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other,
    How I Met Your Mother does not introduce Ted's wife until the eighth-season finale.
